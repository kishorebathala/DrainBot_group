# Robot For Drainage Blockage Systems

# Overview
In modern cities, drainage blockages caused by plastic, grease, and other waste result in urban flooding, health risks, and costly maintenance. This project aims to develop an autonomous robotic system to detect and locate blockages in drainage systems efficiently using cameras, sensors, and real-time data transmission.

# Features

Autonomous Navigation: Uses GPS and Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) to move through drainage networks.
Real-Time Detection: Equipped with ultrasonic and infrared sensors to detect blockages.
Reduced Manual Labor: Minimizes the need for human intervention in dangerous environments.
Cost-Effective: Designed with affordable components like Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
Improved Safety: Lowers exposure to hazardous conditions for workers.


# Technologies and Components

Microcontrollers: Raspberry Pi and Arduino Uno
Sensors: Ultrasonic, Infrared Cameras, GPS
Motors: DC and Stepper Motors for precise movement
Software: Neural networks for blockage detection and control algorithms
Communication Module: Real-time data monitoring via remote interface
